Convert Contact Form 7 forms into Gravity Forms forms.

== Description ==

## Re-written! Ignore the bad reviews :-)

We've finally re-written the plugin, so check it out and see for yourself before you let the bad reviews stop you!


> This plugin requires both the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/contact-form-7/" rel="nofollow">Contact Form 7 plugin and the amazing contact form plugin <a href="http://www.formplugin.com/?r=gfcf7" rel="nofollow">Gravity Forms</a>

## Import your existing Contact Form 7 forms into Gravity Forms
If you are migrating from Contact Form 7 to Gravity Forms, this is the tool for you. Easily import your CF7 forms into Gravity Forms rather than re-creating them manually.

* Recreate notification emails inside Gravity Forms
	- Do you have customized email notifications set up so that you and the submitter receive finely created emails? This plugin will import the email templates into Gravity Forms and will even re-map the CF7 tags for you.
* Create inputs for each of your CF7 form fields
	- Automatically adds labels and __auto-configures input types like name, email, phone, address, and more__.
	- Imports the class names, required fields, maximum input length
	- Also import validation error messages
	- Adds the CF7 input name as Gravity Forms parameter names
